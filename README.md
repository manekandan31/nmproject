##  How It Works

1. **Data Fetching:**
   The frontend fetches product data from the backend via REST API or GraphQL queries.

2. **Rendering Products:**
   Products are displayed in a grid or list layout, showing key details like image, price, and name.

3. **Applying Filters:**

   * When a user selects a filter (e.g., category = “Electronics”), the UI updates dynamically.
   * The filtering logic is handled client-side (for small datasets) or via API queries (for large datasets).

4. **Search and Sorting:**

   * Search input triggers an API call or local filtering.
   * Sorting adjusts product order based on the selected criteria.

5. **Pagination / Infinite Scroll:**

   * Products load in batches to improve performance and user experience.
